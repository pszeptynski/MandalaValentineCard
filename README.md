# Mandala Valentine Card

## About
One screen Android app with a hand-drawn mandala picture.

## Description
This is a project I had to do as a part of Udacity's Google sponsored course "Android Development for Beginners".
We had to design our own card on a piece of paper and use our coding skills to make an app out of it.

This project took me quite a time because I had no idea what to draw and ... how to draw as last time 
I was hand-drawing something was many years ago. Thus I waited for something to come to my mind and then suddenly Valentine's Day 
was coming. In the meantime I realised that drawing a mandala could be a good idea as it should be quite easy and it should also 
affect my mind. :) And that way, the final product - a mixture of mandala and love card - was born. I started with a pencil and a rubber 
and I have drawn some shapes. Then I incorporated the heart shapes. When I was happy with my design I used a black marker pen to finish 
the drawing. Next, I took my phone and made a "photocopy" of the drawing. Then I had to quickly learn to how to crop and resize the 
picture in a graphic program (I used Paint.Net). Finally the picture was ready to attach it to my future app.

Coding was quite easy as I just copied some parts of my previous code and made some changes there. My problem was that the picture was
more like a square and a phone's screen is rectangular, so I needed the way to put the picture into app the way it is almost full screen 
and wholly visible at the same time. I played with some settings until it was right for me. I have also learnt how to remove the app name 
(ActionBar) as it was quite ugly.

It's hard to call it an app as it's mostly written in XML and Android Studio took care of the rest but it's just a beginning, anyway.
